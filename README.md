This site is a simple, one-page design. The top of the page shows a list of the burgers. The user may "eat the burger" and move it into the eaten column, or decide to "make it again."

On the bottom of the site the user can input new burgers. This data persists and is maintained by a MySQL database. The deployed site is hosted through Heroku, and the dynamically created content is handled via Handlebars.

This is a simple site showcasing the use of technologies including: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM using AJAX calls.
