This site is a simple, one-page design. The top of the page shows a list of the burgers. The user may "eat the burger" and move it into the eaten column, or decide to "make it again" and move an eaten burger back to uneaten.

On the bottom of the site the user can input new burgers.

This is a simple site showcasing the use of technologies including: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.
