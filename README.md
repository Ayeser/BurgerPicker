This site is a simple, one-page design. The top of the page shows burgers that are eaten or not eaten (you click buttons to decide this). On the bottom you can input new burgers into the list. This is a simple site showcasing the use of technologies including: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.
